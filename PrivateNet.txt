 I'm assuming you have the geth console installed.
Download and extract the testServer.zip into a suitable location
in the testServer directory and start geth with this command
geth --genesis genesis.json --datadir data --networkid 2016202 --nodiscover console 2>geth.log
this should then connect to the private network peer.
in the geth console you can create an account with
personal.NewAccount()
then start mining with
miner.start(1)
